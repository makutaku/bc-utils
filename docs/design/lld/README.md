## ðŸ”§ Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed implementation specifications for BC-Utils components. These documents provide the technical details needed for development and maintenance.

### Core Implementation Documents
1. **[Component Implementation](01-component-implementation.md)** - Detailed component implementations and patterns
2. **[Data Processing Implementation](02-data-processing-implementation.md)** - Data transformation and validation details  
3. **[Provider Implementation](03-provider-implementation.md)** - Provider-specific integration details
4. **[Storage Implementation](04-storage-implementation.md)** - Storage engine implementation details
5. **[Security Implementation](05-security-implementation.md)** - Security controls and implementation
6. **[Testing Implementation](06-testing-implementation.md)** - Testing strategies and implementation

### Implementation Guidelines

**LLD documents contain:**
- Detailed code implementations and algorithms
- Specific library configurations and parameters
- Error handling implementation details
- Performance optimization techniques
- Database schemas and file formats
- Unit test specifications
- Code patterns and examples

**What's NOT in LLD:**
- High-level architectural decisions (see HLD)
- Business requirements (see PRD)
- Deployment topology (see HLD Deployment Architecture)

### Reading Guide

**For Developers:** Start with the component you're working on
**For Code Reviewers:** Focus on implementation patterns and error handling
**For QA Engineers:** Review testing implementation and validation details
