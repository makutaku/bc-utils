## üìã Document Standards

### Cross-References
- Use relative links: `[Component Architecture](02-component-architecture.md)`
- Include section anchors: `[Storage Layer](05-storage-architecture.md#storage-layer)`
- Reference PRD requirements: `See [REQ-001](../../requirements/prd/product-requirements.md#req-001)`

### Architecture Diagrams
- Use Mermaid for simple diagrams
- External tools (draw.io, Lucidchart) for complex diagrams
- Include both source and rendered versions

### Update Process
- Update HLD when making architectural changes
- Cross-reference related document updates
- Maintain version history and change rationale
